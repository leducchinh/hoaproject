				<div class="Q&A-1">
					<button class="accordion">How do we dial oversea?
						</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>To dial overseas in Singapore through CCS network, users should dial as follow:<br> 1505 + Country Code + Area Code
							+ Destination Number<br> For example, dialing a number in Los Angeles, US:<br> 1505 (prefix) 1 (country code) 213
							(area code) 5541212 (destination number)<br> For 15050 VQ Connect, user can dial as follow:<br> 15050 (prefix) 1 (country
							code) 213 (area code) 5541212 (destination number)</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">What is the problem when you are unable to dial through CCS network?
						</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p style="text-indent:5%;">If you are a new customer, tentatively your number had not been registered yet to our system. You will have to check
							with our customer service team to check if your number has been activated.<br> If you are an existing customer, did
							your Company had recently done any changes to your phone system? If Yes, then we will need to send our technician
							to check on our customer premises devices (if any). If No, then you may need to contact our customer service hotline,
							preferable if you can provide us with the numbers dialed. We will do a thorough check and revert to you soonest.<br>							In most cases, it could be due to busy line at the destination receivable party or incorrect number dialed.<br> There
							are some unique situation where the customer numbers had been barred by their fixed line provider to access 15XX prefixes.
							In this case, customer may need to contact their fixed line provider to release the block.<br> Otherwise, please kindly
							contact our customer service hotline for verification. Our Customer Service will test and remedy the situation if
							failure of network is found.</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">Do we need to install any Customer Premises Device (CPE) to utilise our services?
						</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p style="text-indent:5%;">It will depend on the customers dialing habit. In fact, it is not mandatory to do so as customer can choose to dial
							CCS prefix 1505 manually for making any international call. However, if customer would not want to change their usual
							way of dialing, like using already pre-programmed memory dial, we are able to install a device known as an autodialer.
							This <a href="#CPE">CPE</a> is able to perform the necessary digit conversion and route all of the customer calls
							to CCS voice network. In some phone system, programming can be done within itself by a certified phone system engineer,
							depending on the make of the phone system.</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">If we are using ISDN-30, are we able to use CCS services?
						</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p style="text-indent:5%;">Yes, customer who are using ISDN-30 connected to their digital phone system are able to utlise CCS voice network by
							either manual dial, programming to be done on the phone system or by installing an autodialer that is meant for ISDN-30
							lines. However, we do not support lines on ISDN 2B+D as we do not have a supported autodialer. Customers with such
							lines will only be possible to dial through us manually.</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">If we are using the Centrex System, are we able to utilize CCS services?
						</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p style="text-indent:5%;">We are able to support analog centrex system, where the phone line that is laid to customer premises are analog in
							nature. We should be able to install an autodialer on such lines. However, we are unable to support digital centrex
							system with our autodialer. Therefore, manual dial is the only option for digital centrex system. Alternatively, customer
							can program the numbers with our 1505 prefix into their memory dial setup, to route their calls to CCS voice network.</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">Why are we able to provide such services at such low cost?
						</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p style="text-indent:5%;">The reason is that we are buying bulk wholesale minutes. We have worked with various carriers since we started our
							services, which helps us in maintaining consistent low rates that we can provide to our customers.</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">Why do phone numbers in other countries has a leading 0?
						</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p style="text-indent:5%;">Singapore is a small country where we are a single state country. In other countries, usually they are made up of different
							states. For example, in China, different states number will have different area code. Shanghai 21, Beijing 10. To
							call a number from Shanghai to Beijing, the user will dial 0 10 12345678. For user to call from Shanghai to Beijing,
							the user will dial 0 21 12345678. This is a standard way to dial a domestic or inter-state call. In some situation,
							if you call within the same province, it will still work without dialing the leading 0.<br> If you are in Singapore,
							and your business associates business card states the phone numbers with a leading 0, you will need to omit the leading
							0 and dial as follow:<br> 0 21 12345678 -> 1505 86 21 12345678</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">Why the international prefix for other countries are different from Singapore?
						</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p style="text-indent:5%;">This is because the telecommunication business in Singapore is fully liberalized. There are many different Long Distance
							Calls provider, operating using different prefixes. In Singapore, we usually make IDD calls using 3-digit prefixes
							like 001,002, 008, 018,019 or 021 provided by FBO. For all SBO, a 4 digit prefix Is used with a leading 15 follow
							by 2 other numbers that is issued by IDA. For CCS, our prefix will be 1505.</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">Can we use CCS 1505 or 15050 services while overseas?
						</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p style="text-indent:5%;">While you are overseas and you want to call to a Singapore number from the foreign destination, you will need to dial
							either with a leading + or 00. These are the international Direct Dial prefix for most countries with more than 1
							state or province. Please kindly take note that the 1505 Premium Connect / 15050 VQ Connect services we are providing
							is only applicable in Singapore.</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">Is there possibilities for customers phone systems be hacked?</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p style="text-indent:5%;">In traditional phone systems where there is no data links, where there is no internet connectivity, the only possible
							tap is to physically access the telephone wires. Therefore, access to risers and telephone lines termination point
							at customer premises should be prohibited to non-essential personnel.<br> Due to the trend where Companies resort
							to linking up cross border offices, a new form of phone systems are introduced. In fact, most phone systems providers
							have introduced phone systems with internet protocol ability. The software within the phone systems will allow inter-office
							calls at no costs. However, this will bring threats from the internet where hackers had made used of the new form
							of media to infiltrate the phone systems, which had resulted in heavy losses to customer due to to make unsolicited
							calls through the customer phone system.<br> However, ip enabled phone system may not be the only way where the system
							can be compromised. There are some IP phones or IP gateways that can be installed on direct phone lines or behind
							any phone systems, which can be a serious threat to Company phone lines being hacked.</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">How can we make protection to prevent Internet Protocol (IP) enabled phone systems being hacked?
						</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p style="text-indent:5%;">In order to fence off attacks from hackers, the most important thing to do is to ensure that the default administrator
							password to the phone system is changed. Possibly, it should be change at least at intervals of 3 months. If the IP
							feature is not utilised, the phone system should never leave to connect to the Internet. Also, customers should not
							allow any IP enabled voice device to be installed within any part of the phone system unless the installation is properly
							secured either by Company Administrator or its product specialists.<br> It must be remember that service providers
							are only able to detect such attacks when there is a surge amount of calls leading to non-frequently called destinations.
							These destinations are usually very high in costs and somehow that even service provider are unable to notice due
							to the high volume of traffic passing through the routes they are using.<br> Therefore, prevention is always the safest
							bet to ensure that your phone system is properly secured before enabling the IP capabilities. If the phone systems
							is compromised, then it may result to serious losses to the customer as in most of the situation, the customer may
							have to bear the costs for all the unsolicted calls.</p>

  					</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p style="text-indent:5%;">Callback is an old technology but effective way of saving costs to make a call while roaming. It will be able to cut
							down probably about 50% of the cost if users were to dial directly from their mobile phone while roaming.<br> For
							CCS Callback Service, we will provide customer with a Singapore Number to dial to. This number is basically a triggering
							number. What it does is that when dialed, it will be able to reach our Singapore network, and our system will hang
							up the call upon receiving it. This is an non-connected call which therefore it’s not chargeable.<br> Upon triggering,
							our network will do a call back to the subscriber’s mobile number as registered in advance with us. The subscriber
							will then answer the incoming call, and will be asked to dial the destination numbers and end with a # key. Customer
							should dial the country code, follow by area code, follow by destination and end with a # key. Once the # key is received,

					<div class="panel">
						<p style="text-indent:5%;">R Tone if under a good data network connectivity can achieve voice quality as good as what we are able to achieve as
							in our mobile call. We are spending good effort to improvise and ensure our voice can achieve its best quality even

							can view if the contacts are online or offline. It can also determined if the messages is being received or read by
							the receivers. There are 2 forms of how IM stores the messages. All the messages can be stored within the phone itself
							or it can be stored in a server. For IM that stores messages in the phone, messages will be lost if the app is installed
							onto another phone unless a backup is done and restore in the new phone. For server kept messages, you can still recover
							the messages for a period of time even if you may have installed the app in a new phone. The duration of how long
							to keep the messages can be configurable as well. IM has been an uproaring trend to the traditional Short Message
							System (SMS) used in mobile phones network. It has more interesting way to present gesture with emotion icons where
							traditional SMS is dull and limited to the amount of text send per message. The interface for IM also allows transmission
							of files across the users, which can serve like a mini collaboration tools. However, there is limitation to the use
							of IM, both users must installed the same application in order to use the services. Also, it has always been questionable
							on how secure when sending messages via IM unless service provider put in place some sort of encryption for point
							to point messaging.</p>
